# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

## RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

<hr>

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Installation

<hr>

This project is developed using **angular 13.2.2** and **ionic 6.0.0**.

To develop the project it is necessary to install nodejs, the installation of node is different in each operating system (see installation documentation).
After doing this you need to install angular.

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

after installing angular it is necessary to install ionic.

` npm install -g @ionic/cli`

After installing ionic I generated the project only with Cordova as Capacitor gives me some problems.

`ionic start nameProject blank --type=angular --cordova`

The following project is divided into 2 parts.
